##### 在线沟通/即时聊天工具

一般情况下，已合作的客户一定会回复你，未收到回复一般有2 种原因
1. 因为server 问题或者其他原因，客户压根没有成功收到你的email
2. 收到了，还没找到时间回复你
所以这个时候应该主动跟客户即时聊天工具互动起来
把邮件的内容再copy 传递一遍

重点传递两个信号
1. 有新品，跟他相关度非常高
2. 会邀请老板和客户一起参会推动接下来的合作深化

**==把你手上已合作的客户借助展会升级成公司的超级VIP==**

#### 新客户邀约三部曲

##### 展会邮件邀请

> [!NOTE] 注意
> 1. 先简单介绍你和自己的公司，和展会的信息
> 2. 告诉他你有关注他们很久，顺便夸一夸他们市场做得很好，相信他们对你们的新品是有兴趣的，发一个新品的资料介绍引起一下他的兴趣。欢迎他展位来聊一聊潜在的合作机会。
> 3. 即便没有合作也可以先认识成为朋友，而且了解市场动态可以更好的做大本地市场。
>     不要让客户有压力。买卖不成，情义在。
>     也提出疑问，让客户有意愿回复你。
> 4. 感谢他可以考虑参加你们的邀请，期待他的回复。
