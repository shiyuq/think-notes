It's a fast growing category, since the market size has been growing fast from about $200M to more than $3B from 2019 to 2021 and keeping the YoY of 200% in 2022.

#### 新客户说行业发展趋势  

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 找出客户所在行业的弱点，加以告知最新的发展趋势，引导合作，提前布局，引领市场

Your current product is more in traditional field, but with the development of the industry, users increasingly demand DlY products, you can start to do the market strategy in advance.

#### 客户已经有供应商

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 不要上来让客户换你，那就是让客户否定之前自己的决定，你要做的是谦卑加体现实力，肯定他现有的供应商的优秀，但事无巨细，总会有供应不足的时候，让客户可以选择自己作为备选，引导从小订单开始，让客户看到自己产品的质量和服务，慢慢取而代之。

I know you are already working with suppliers, and your suppliers should be excellent, so you have been working with them.
But l believe you will also need another supplier. Maybe later when there is a shortage of supply. Anyway it's safest to have a plan B.
You can start with us from a small order or trial order to see how our quality and service.

#### 客户说曾经被骗，不太愿意相信中国供应商

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 首先表达关心，其次表述中国还是有很多用心做产品的公司，例如我们公司，表达歉意现在才主动找到客户，请求客户给一个合作机会，让客户看到自己的诚意。

I'm really sorry to hear that, you must have lost a lot of money.
But there are a lot of other great companies out there in China that have been doing great products and services, like our company.
It's also our fault that we didn't find you until now, Please also give us a chance,we have so many Europe and the United States’ customers for so long, there is a reason, l believe that will not let you down.

#### 呈现你的行业专业度和产品力

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 表现自己的专业度，自己的公司实力，合作的客户做到的成就，解决问题的方式、速度、质量等等，定制化方案支持等多角度均能让客户了解到你的实力和诚意

We are very familiar with this market, few of the top industry's customers are cooperating with us. Based on different types of customer needs, we have different solutions. That's the reason we do our own R & D investment, as we could do a lot of customized solutions from the product and price strategy.

#### 客户想要独家，但反馈说你这边已经有合作客户了不愿意合作

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 如果客户表示市场上已经有了你合作的几个客户，但是他想要你只提供给他一家，那么你可以表示很感兴趣，这取决于后续客户的销售计划，如果计划很不错的话后续的新产品的独家代理可以给到客户

这里就是你不反对，试探客户的底牌，了解客户的需求量，如果利大于弊，可以选择转向合作，但肯定需要确认好起订量以及试错周期

Although we already have these two companies you mentioned in this market,but if you want to cooperate exclusively, we are also interested, depending on what you want to do with your sales plan after making the exclusive, if all be good, we can give you exclusive right of one of the newly released products.
After one year, if we reach the sales target set by both sides, we can turn these two or three customers exclusively as your secondary agent, and our factory will sacrifice profit to ensure both of you two, and you will increase your yearly sales revenue for sure.

#### 第三方立场

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 站在第三方的角度看待当前的行业问题，替客户着想，为了不让竞争对手慢慢追上自己，可以对比之后再做决定，这对您来说并无损失，强调自己的产品值得客户了解，能够让他在行业内保持竞争力

You surely want your company to remain the best competitive in the industry,and our products are definitely worth knowing. If you miss it, it is likely to give your local competitor a good opportunity to slowly catch up with you. At least there is nothing to lose by comparing and then deciding.

#### 一站式服务政策

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 说出自己的优势，是沟通快，还是售后好，还是发货快，还是有区域保护，还是有活动促销

We have a well-established local storage and logistics center, as well as an after-sales team. We can provide DDP US price, delivery to your door.
We also have a price protection policy for our partners, if you buy and have a problem with promotion or price reduction within 6 months, we will give you an allowance for inventory.
So you can try to sell our products with complete confidence, we also have a lot of promotion activities to help our partners to do sell-out.

#### 推荐款式

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 一定要基于客户的基本情况做产品推荐，给一堆产品给客户是没有用的，初期介绍时可以全盘展示，但是后期引荐时一定要做取舍，也要有**==陪跑的产品==**

This product A is our best selling product in the whole company, you can take a small order first to check the market feedback.
If you decide to do it in a big wave, we can also recommend you the higher specification and cost effective B. Because this product has just been launched, the market competition is much less. We can come together to do the price strategy.

#### 产品差异化推荐

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 针对不同的情况，不同的市场，给到用户不同的建议，当然需要体现自己的产品受欢迎的程度，在不同情况下，受欢迎的产品不同，给到客户选择和思考，客户也会认为我在替他考虑，打开后续他所在的市场推荐的相关聊天

In our general CE channels, product A sells best, in the tools channels, product B sells more, and in the project category, product C is more popular.
In the European, American and Japanese markets, where quality is top priority, our product A sells best, and in the Southeast Asian market, our product B got more attention, as the customers are seeking higher cost performance. In markets such as Latin America and India, our product C is the most popular.

### how? 怎么样

#### 引导拿样

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 引导拿样

You can take 2 samples back to test first and compare what you think is the best selling product locally.

#### 引导小批

>[!NOTE] 总结
>中性包装的产品，你可以先买一箱让你的同事和部分渠道去测试

For the neutral packaging items, you can buy a carton for your colleagues and some channels to test first.

#### 引导减少MOQ

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 如果用户犹豫不决，那么可以引导用户购买中性产品，这样对于企业来说没有压力，并且也可以引导成交

Our MOQ normally is 2000 units. If you think you want to test the market feedback first you can start with just the logo of the machine and keep our standard color box, so that the MOQ only needs 200 units.

#### 引导做品牌

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 如果客户想要做代理商而不是自己的品牌，那么也可以引导客户，我们可以提供区域独家代理，相对应的区域的新客户以及询盘后续都会直接推给你

Our brand is currently looking for agents locally, so if you can also do distribution, we can give you exclusive rights. If we receive some inquiries from local business opportunities, we will also forward them to you.

#### 引导先做online website

> [!NOTE] 总结
>  可以先从你们的网站先开始推广我们的产品，如果销售反馈好你再买更多进入线下门店

You can start promoting our products from your website first, and if the sales feedback is good you can buy more into the offline stores.

#### 引导先做电商平台

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 总之也是站在客户的立场上，小成本试错，验证产品质量可靠或者市场反馈不错再引入到其他渠道

You can start with local e-commerce platforms, such as Amazon, Newegg and Walmart and if the quality of our products is proven to be reliable, you can then introduce them to all other channels.

#### 设门槛给独家模具

> [!NOTE] 总结
> 这个产品A，我们可以授权只给你们公司，但是我们需要有一个保证金5 万美金，如果累积销量一年内达到20 万台，我们退回5 万美金或抵扣货款。因为我们模具的开发也成本很高，总之不轻易给客户开模，可以引导客户签署对赌协议，这样对于我们来说损失最小，也要考虑客人的体量
> ==**如果是大客人，你也许需要做一些让利，不能将全部的风险转到客户一边，这样会容易让你失去他**==

For this product A, we can authorize it to your company only, but we need to have a deposit of $50,000, and if the total sales quantity reach 200,000 units in one year, we will return this $50,000 or deduct in the further orders. Because the development of new mold is also very costly.

#### 先做市场分析，再做产品策略

>[!NOTE] 总结
>我们一起来分析目前泰国的线上线下同类产品，做好基准。再来基于我们的产品和你们需要的利润，我们做个完整的策略。
>我们可能需要一款非常高性价比的产品先打入市场，让用户先知道我们。你们觉得如何?
>我们后续有持续的新产品在研发，所以刚进入市场可能需要我们双方都在某些产品上调整-下利润比例。
>**==也就是先做市场的分析，如果产品的销量可以，那么就用主推款先把名气打出去，当然在前期应该是双方都要在利润上做让步，后续再提高利润基准。==**

Let's analyze the current online and offline similar products in Thailand, make a good benchmark, and then let's make a complete strategy based on our products and the profit you need.
We may need a very cost effective product to hit the market first and let the users know about us. What do you think?
We have a lot of new products in development, so when we are at the beginning of entering the market may require both of us to adjust the profit expectation on certain products.

#### 付款方式(payment terms)

>[!NOTE] 总结
>付款方式我跟公司申请给你做账期，但是需要获得中信保的批复。如果能批复成功，你们可以有更多的资金流去投入市场，希望可以把我们的业务提升。

I'll apply to the company for credit, but I'll need to get approval from sinosure company. If the approval is successful, you can have more cash flow to invest in the market and hopefully boost our business.

#### 售后条款

The after sales we can be divided into 3 cases:
1. lf you are not sure how much after-sales workload there is, then first our U.S. local after-sales center will undertake, and all the users can contact direct to return and exchange goods We give you credit according to quantity. We check monthly or quarterly.
2. It is best if your after-sales team can do a triage job to check which are really defective products, and return them to us for credit, because many are returned for no reason by the users, and only need to do the refurbishment then can be sold again.
   This can greatly save logistics costs, we can also provide you with free packaging and accessories for refurbishment work.
   We also provide an additional 1% of the purchase amount for your after-sales manpower. What do you think?
3. lf you are doing the Latin American market, we currently do not have a local after-sales center, and it is not convenient to bring back defective products, we can provide 3% of each order RMA, for your after-sales team service and refurbishment work, lf there is a small amount of defective products are also included in it.
