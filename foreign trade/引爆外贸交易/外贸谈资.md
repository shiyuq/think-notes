产品的快速增长，前景广阔

#### 新客户说行业发展趋势  

找出客户所在行业的弱点，加以告知最新的发展趋势，引导合作，提前布局，引领市场

Your current product is more in traditional field, but with the development of the industry, users increasingly demand DlY products, you can start to do the market strategy in advance.

#### 客户已经有供应商

不要上来让客户换你，那就是让客户否定之前自己的决定，你要做的是谦卑加体现实力，肯定他现有的供应商的优秀，但事无巨细，总会有供应不足的时候，让客户可以选择自己作为备选，引导从小订单开始，让客户看到自己产品的质量和服务，慢慢取而代之。

I know you are already working with suppliers, and your suppliers should be excellent, so you have been working with them.
But l believe you will also need another supplier. Maybe later when there is a shortage of supply. Anyway it's safest to have a plan B.
You can start with us from a small order or trial order to see how our quality and service.

#### 客户说曾经被骗，不太愿意相信中国供应商

首先表达关心，其次表述中国还是有很多用心做产品的公司，例如我们公司，表达歉意现在才主动找到客户，请求客户给一个合作机会，让客户看到自己的诚意。

I'm really sorry to hear that, you must have lost a lot of money.
But there are a lot of other great companies out there in China that have been doing great products and services, like our company.
It's also our fault that we didn't find you until now, Please also give us a chance,we have so many Europe and the United States’ customers for so long, there is a reason, l believe that will not let you down.

#### 呈现你的行业专业度和产品力

表现自己的专业度，自己的公司实力，合作的客户做到的成就，解决问题的方式、速度、质量等等，定制化方案支持等多角度均能让客户了解到你的实力和诚意

We are very familiar with this market, few of the top industry's customers are cooperating with us. Based on different types of customer needs, we have different solutions. That's the reason we do our own R & D investment, as we could do a lot of customized solutions from the product and price strategy.

#### 客户想要独家，但反馈说你这边已经有合作客户了不愿意合作

如果客户表示市场上已经有了你合作的几个客户，但是他想要你只提供给他一家，那么你可以表示很感兴趣，这取决于后续客户的销售计划，如果计划很不错的话后续的新产品的独家代理可以给到客户

这里就是你不反对，试探客户的底牌，了解客户的需求量，如果利大于弊，可以选择转向合作，但肯定需要确认好起订量以及试错周期

Although we already have these two companies you mentioned in this market,but if you want to cooperate exclusively, we are also interested, depending on what you want to do with your sales plan after making the exclusive, if all be good, we can give you exclusive right of one of the newly released products.
After one year, if we reach the sales target set by both sides, we can turn these two or three customers exclusively as your secondary agent, and our factory will sacrifice profit to ensure both of you two, and you will increase your yearly sales revenue for sure.

#### 第三方立场

站在第三方的角度看待当前的行业问题，替客户着想，为了不让竞争对手慢慢追上自己，可以对比之后再做决定，这对您来说并无损失，强调自己的产品值得客户了解，能够让他在行业内保持竞争力

You surely want your company to remain the best competitive in the industry,and our products are definitely worth knowing. If you miss it, it is likely to give your local competitor a good opportunity to slowly catch up with you. At least there is nothing to lose by comparing and then deciding.

#### 一站式服务政策

说出自己的优势，是沟通快，还是售后好，还是发货快，还是有区域保护，还是有活动促销

We also have a price protection policy for our partners, if you buy and have a problem with promotion or price reduction within 6 months, we will give you an allowance for inventory.
So you can try to sell our products with complete confidence, we also have a lot of promotion activities to help our partners to do sell-out.

#### 推荐款式

一定要基于客户的基本情况做产品推荐，给一堆产品给客户是没有用的，初期介绍时可以全盘展示，但是后期引荐时一定要做取舍，也要有**==陪跑的产品==**

This product A is our best selling product in the whole company, you can take a small order first to check the market feedback.
If you decide to do it in a big wave, we can also recommend you the higher specification and cost effective B. Because this product has just been launched, the market competition is much less. We can come together to do the price strategy.

#### 产品差异化推荐

针对不同的情况，不同的市场，给到用户不同的建议，当然需要体现自己的产品受欢迎的程度，在不同情况下，受欢迎的产品不同，给到客户选择和思考，客户也会认为我在替他考虑，打开后续他所在的市场推荐的相关聊天

In our general CE channels, product A sells best, in the tools channels, product B sells more, and in the project category, product C is more popular.
In the European, American and Japanese markets, where quality is top priority, our product A sells best, and in the Southeast Asian market, our product B got more attention, as the customers are seeking higher cost performance. In markets such as Latin America and India, our product C is the most popular.
